Remember this:
-Values:
--Numbers (Use Math with numbers!(% means remainder after dividing!)) (Fractions are seperated with "."(3 and a half= 3.5) Scientific notation can also be used)
---Special Numbers (INFINITY but also NEGATIVE INFINITY)
--Strings (Its THE FUNNY "" words) ("words\n words" the "\n" means NewLine) ("\" can be written in strings by putting 2 of them together like: "words \\ words" = "Words\Words") (Strings can also be used like numbers, Being able to be added and subtracted!)
--Unary Operators (Unary operators use one value whine Binary use two.) ("typeof" outputs the type of value in front of it.)
--Booleans (JS uses True/False as its's boolean type) ("<" Less than, ">" Greater than, "<=" Less than or equal to, ">=" Greater than or equal to, "==" equals to, "=!" Does not equal) 
---Logical Operators: (still produce true or false) ("&&=and" Both values must be true, "|| = Or" Only one value must be true) 
--Empty values ("Null" or "Undefined" work, according to Author, They are mostly interchangeable due to JS's Writing.)
